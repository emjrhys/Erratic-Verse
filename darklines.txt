eyes like shattered glass
a dying soul, a single tear wept
through a dark forest
my one hope, stolen
your warm embrace stings like the cold
the sunset reminds me
swimming in an endless void
the inorganic blood of empty souls
a final sunset
dying on a distant shore
emptiness
fantastic! Not
why? I disappear
misunderstanding
for the last time
piercing my heart
I collect my tears in a fishbowl
the falling stones of my existence
the crumbling pillars of my humanity
the rasping breath of a fallen angel
I fall into oblivion
