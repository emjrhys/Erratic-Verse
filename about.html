        	Erratic Verse was created by four high school students with too much free time. Josh Loevner (design) is some creepy guy who follows the rest of the team around. Noah Lafferty (programmer) is the brains of the team, creating the original program and most of the website. Aaren Barge (poet) is the chief economic advisor for Erratic Verse. Noah Vito does stuff too, sometimes.
