        Erratic Verse was developed and designed by four high school students attending Winchester Thurston School. It was created as a social experiment examining the poetic nature of collective human thought.  Each line of submitted poetry represents the distinct emotional experience of individual users and the poems generated by Erratic Verse express a small part the combined conscience.
